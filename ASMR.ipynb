    "# Importing our Dataset and Installing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a dataset that we obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/irfanasrullah/groceries). It contains 9835 individual independent transactions, and a total of 169 unique products across them. This is saved in a groceries.csv file in the same directory, where each row represents one transaction in a comma-separated list. We are considering the row-number to be the transaction ID as there was no other transaction ID present in the dataset, but our code would work the same if there had been a transaction ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "The snippet of code has the following functions:\n",
    "* ```importCSV(file)``` - uses Python’s csv package to import a CSV file and return it as a list\n",
    "* ```checkExists(item, dictionary)``` - this is our own library function which checks if string **item** is present in a list **dictionary**. Returns True or False accordingly.\n",
    "* ```findUniqueItems(A)``` - parses through a transactions dataset, and creates a list of all unique items in it. Returns a list B containing all the unique items.\n",
    "* ```createTransactionFrequency(uniqueItems, transactionList)``` - this creates and returns an auxiliary array containing the TIDs (from *transactionList*) of all the transactions where each unique item (from *uniqueItems*) occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also install the Python packages for ```matplotlib``` and ```upsetplot``` which will be used to visualize our data in the following sections. \n"

    "\n",
    "This section of code is the powerhouse of our project, as it parses through the entire transactions database and identifies all the items and itemsets that occur in more transactions than our support cutoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "The snippet of code has the following functions:\n",
    "* ```printList(R, L, k)``` - Currently, R[0] contains all the unique items, and L[0] contains lists of all the TIDs where the corresponding item occurs in (for example: ```R[0][0] = ‘whole milk’```; ```L[0][0] = [14, 36, 11, 78]```). This function creates all 1-itemsets which are above the support threshold (hence printed as Level 1). \n",
    "* ```getLevels(R, L, k)``` - Performs the same operations as printList, but for all higher levels until no more itemsets are generated. For lower support thresholds, expect to generate more levels. \n",
    "* ```checkDuplicates(P, T)``` - Goes through the itemsets and TID lists generated at each iteration by getLevels, and removes duplicate itemsets. ```[‘whole milk’, ‘citrus fruits’]``` and ```[‘citrus fruits’, ‘whole milk’]``` should not both be present, as they are equal. We optimize this process by only comparing string comparisons on lists which have the same list of TIDs, as the TIDs are always stored in ascending order. Returns cleaned up lists. \n",
    "* ```compareLists(L1, L2)``` - wrapper function to check if two lists intersect completely. \n",
    "* ```ntersection(lst1, lst2)``` - This function takes in two lists of TIDs and returns the intersection of them. \n",

    "## A Note on the Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "For plotting the items/itemsets above the support threshold along with their frequencies, we use an UpSet Plot ```(thanks Koishore)```. Reading this plot is fairly straightforward: the section below the column-graph represents the items/itemsets. There is a list of unique items on the left hand side, and the filled dots together represent an itemset. The corresponding column above each itemset represents the number of transactions where the itemset occurs in. If you look at the area which displays the itemsets - you can vaguely identify triangular structures in the sets, each of these are associated with a single item which is at the bottom. The descending columns at the top give a brief idea about which items occur together, which we will show with more detail in the next section. \n",
